      "Title: Strictly’s Annabel Croft claims ‘psychopath’ nurse ‘gloated’ as she told husband he was dying – and had just hours left\n",
      "Content: HEARTBROKEN Strictly star Annabel Croft has told of her horrifying experience as her husband died in hospital.\n",
      "The tennis legend claims a \"psychopathic\" nurse appeared to gloat as she delivered the devastating news.\n",
      "Widow Annabel, 57, lost her husband, Mel Coleman, to cancer in May after 36 years old marriage.\n",
      "There was only 16 weeks between his diagnosis and death. \n",
      "In an emotional interview with the Daily Mail, Annabel says an NHS nurse laughed and mocked her son who asked if he had months to live.\n",
      "\"I've asked myself, since, if she was a psychopath,\" sobbed Annabel. \n",
      "\"It felt like it because she seemed to take pleasure in telling Mel he was dying.\n",
      "\"She started talking about palliative care and Charlie [our son] asked her: 'What does that mean? Does he have months, weeks?'\n",
      "\"She said: 'Huh!' Almost laughing, mocking our son. 'No — hours.' Mel heard that, all of it. It was just awful.\"\n",
      "The nurse then said if Mel had a heart attack he would not be resuscitated.\n",
      "Despite the couple objecting to this, Annabel claims she doubled down.\n",
      "\"It was like she was enjoying it,\" she said.\n",
      "\"I'm haunted by that. So many nights it has kept me awake, remembering the tone of her voice. It was cruel.\"\n",
      "Mel was Annabel's first serious boyfriend. They married in 1992 and had three children together - Amber, Charlie and Lily, who are all in their 20s.\n",
