## Working with conda's environments

_Alek chcesz ogarnąć ten inny pakiet do zarządania pakietami/dependencjami?_

You should be able to create this environment by running 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
If you already have an environment named `inzEnv`, then you'll likely get an error. The easy solution is removing the previous env, but maybe you can find some way to update it? idk, haven't googled it...
